#JavaScript Resources


This is a repository for all the JavaScript resources that I come across and believe are worth sharing and archiving. It will continue to grow with time, so check back frequently. Feel free to fork the project and contribute!

###General/Fundies
- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke and his [Github Repo](https://github.com/marijnh/Eloquent-JavaScript) for the book
